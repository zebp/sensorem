# sensorem

Colorful sensors!

## Features

- Colorful output, yay!
- Watch mode

## Todo

### Config files

Ideally sensorem could have config files so we could turn a name like `k10temp-pci-00c3` into `AMD Ryzen 9 5950x`, whitelist sensors that should be displayed, ranges for certain display colors, etc.

### Fan RPM support

Currently sensorem only supports temperatures, but showing fan rpm would also be useful.

### Non sensor based input sources

For some devices it might be nice to know why a device might be running at a given temperature, so things like clock speed or IO throughput could be displayed.
